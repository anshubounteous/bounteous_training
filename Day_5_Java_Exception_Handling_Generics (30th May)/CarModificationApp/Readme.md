# 🚗 Car Customization Console App (Java)

A command-line Car Customization Application that simulates selecting and modifying car models using a modular design. It demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, interface-model-service architecture, Java Collections, and abstraction.

---

## 📦 Overview

This application allows users to:

* Choose from various car base models (SUV, Sedan, Hatchback)
* Customize the car with additional features (e.g., sunroof, music system)
* View full configuration details and final price

---

## 🧠 System Design & Architecture

The project uses **interface-driven development** with three main layers:

1. **Model Layer**

   * Represents data entities like `Car`, `Customization`
2. **Service Layer**

   * Implements business logic like applying modifications and calculating prices
3. **App Layer (Main.java)**

   * Handles user interaction through the command line

## 🔧 Car Types and Features

### Base Models:

* 🚙 SUV
* 🚗 Sedan
* 🚕 Hatchback

### Possible Customizations:

* Sunroof
* Alloy Wheels
* Touchscreen Infotainment
* Music System
* Leather Seats

Each base model has a base price. Final price = base price + total cost of selected features.

| Concept          | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| OOP              | Inheritance (Car subclasses), Polymorphism, Abstraction |
| Interface        | `CarService` decouples logic from implementation        |
| Java Collections | Feature storage using List/Map                          |
| Modularity       | Easy to extend with new car types or features           |
