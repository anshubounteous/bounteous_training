## 🧠 System Design & Logic

### 📌 `TaxPayer`

* Fields: name, age, annualIncome, deductions
* Age category logic:

  * < 60: General
  * 60–79: Senior Citizen
  * 80+: Super Senior Citizen

### 📌 `Deduction`

* Holds deduction values for 80C, 80D, and Section 24
* Uses validation against maximum deduction limits from `TaxConstants`

### 📌 `TaxCalculatorService`

* Interface with methods to:

  * Calculate tax
  * Apply deductions
  * Return summary details

### 📌 `TaxCalculatorServiceImpl`

* Implements logic for tax slab calculations
* Uses conditions for slab thresholds and progressive tax logic
* Applies deduction reductions from taxable income before computing tax
