# Java Product Management Console App

This **Java-based product management system** is a console application built using object-oriented principles, interfaces, and the Java Collections framework. It enables the management of products with full CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and duplicate prevention.

## System Design & Architecture

This application uses the following architecture layers:

```
+------------------+
|    Main.java     |  <-- Entry point (CLI interaction)
+------------------+
        |
        v
+---------------------------+
|   ProductServiceImpl.java |
| (implements ProductService)|
+---------------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------+
|  Product.java     |  <-- Model class
+------------------+
```

### Folder Structure

```
src/
├── model/
│   └── Product.java
├── service/
│   ├── ProductService.java
│   └── ProductServiceImpl.java
└── main/
    └── Main.java
```

## Class Responsibilities

### `Product.java`

Represents a single product with:

* `String name`
* `double price`
* `String category`

### `ProductService`

Defines the operations allowed:

* `addProduct(Product)`
* `getProductByName(String)`
* `getAllProducts()`
* `updateProduct(Product)`
* `deleteProduct(String name)`
* `sortProductsBy(String field)`
* `filterByCategory(String)`
* `filterByPriceRange(double min, double max)`

### `ProductServiceImpl`

Implements logic and stores products using `HashMap<String, Product>`.
Uses Stream API for sorting and filtering operations.
Prevents addition of duplicate product names.
