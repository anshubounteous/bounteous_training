# 🛒 Java Product Catalog Console App

This project is a **Java-based console application** for managing a product catalog. It allows users to add, retrieve, update, delete, sort, and filter products. Built using an interface-model-service architecture, it showcases the use of Java Collections, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Stream API.

### 🔹 Product.java

Represents a product with:

* ID
* Name
* Category
* Price
* Rating

### 🔹 ProductService

Interface that defines:

* `addProduct()`
* `getProductById()` / `getProductByName()`
* `getAllProducts()`
* `deleteProductById()`
* `updateProduct()`
* `sortBy()` / `filterBy()`

### 🔹 ProductServiceImpl

* Implements all product operations
* Uses `HashMap<String, Product>` to store products
* Uses Stream API for filtering and sorting
